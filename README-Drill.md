# User Defined Function for Apache Drill

## Introduction
This is an Apache Drill UDF for parsing User Agent Strings.
This function was originally created by [Charles S. Givre](https://github.com/cgivre) and was imported into
the main Yauaa project to ensure users would have a prebuilt and up to date version available.

# STATUS: ... Works on my machine ...
I have copied/implemented the functions

    parse_user_agent       ( <useragent> )
    parse_user_agent_field ( <useragent> , <desired fieldname> )

Able to do basic unit test during build for the parse_user_agent_field function.
NOT yet able to do automated testing for the parse_user_agent function.

When I run it in a local drill the things I try work for the most (see below).
I have not yet tested this in a distributed setup.

So please try it out and report any issues and/or improvements you see.

## Getting the UDF
You can get the prebuilt UDF from [maven central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cyauaa-drill).
This is the maven dependency definition where it can be downloaded.

    <dependency>
      <groupId>nl.basjes.parse.useragent</groupId>
      <artifactId>yauaa-drill</artifactId>
      <version>4.3</version>
    </dependency>

## Building
Simply install the normal build tools for a Java project (i.e. maven and jdk 8+) and then simply do:

    mvn clean package

The jar file for Apache Drill can be found as

    ./udfs/drill/function/target/yauaa-drill-<version>.jar

## Installation
To install this function put the jar file in the <drill-path>/jars/3rdparty directory.

    cp ./udfs/drill/target/yauaa-drill-<version>.jar <drill-path>/jars/3rdparty

Make sure you replace `<drill-path>` with your actual path to your drill installation.
NOTE: You do not need the `yauaa-drill-<version>-sources.jar` to run in drill.

# Usage and examples

Working queries with a direct value

    SELECT parse_user_agent_field('Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/48.0.2564.82 Safari/537.36', 'AgentNameVersion') from (values(1));

    |        EXPR$0        |
    +----------------------+
    | Chrome 48.0.2564.82  |
    +----------------------+


This one doesn't work

    SELECT parse_user_agent('Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/48.0.2564.82 Safari/537.36') from (values(1));

    Error: PLAN ERROR: Failure while materializing expression in constant expression evaluator [PARSE_USER_AGENT('Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/48.0.2564.82 Safari/537.36')].  Errors:

Assume the file ```/tmp/testcase.tsv``` which contains 2 lines:

        "AgentInformationUrl":           "http://www.google.com/bot.html"   } |
    +------------------+

The function returns a Drill map, so you can access any of the fields using Drill's table.map.key notation.
For example, the query below illustrates how to extract a field from this map and summarize it:


    SELECT uadata.ua.AgentNameVersion AS Browser,
    COUNT( * ) AS BrowserCount
    FROM (
       SELECT parse_user_agent( columns[0] ) AS ua
       FROM dfs.`/tmp/testcase.tsv`
    ) AS uadata
    GROUP BY uadata.ua.AgentNameVersion
    ORDER BY BrowserCount DESC;

    +----------------------+---------------+
    |       Browser        | BrowserCount  |
    +----------------------+---------------+
    | Chrome 48.0.2564.82  | 1             |
    | Googlebot 2.1        | 1             |
    +----------------------+---------------+
