# User Defined Function for Apache Flink

## Getting the UDF
You can get the prebuilt UDF from maven central.
If you use a maven based project simply add this dependency to your Apache Flink application.

    <dependency>
      <groupId>nl.basjes.parse.useragent</groupId>
      <artifactId>yauaa-flink</artifactId>
      <version>3.3</version>
    </dependency>

## Building
Simply install the normal build tools for a Java project (i.e. maven and jdk) and then simply do:

    mvn clean package

## Example usage
Assume you have a DataSet or DataStream with your records. 
In most cases I see (clickstream data) these records (In this example this class is called "TestRecord") contain the useragent string in a field and the parsed results must be added to these fields.

Now you must do two things:

  1) Determine the names of the fields you need.
  2) Add an instance of the (abstract) UserAgentAnalysisMapper mapper and implement the functions as shown in the example below. Use the Field annotation to get the setter for the requested fields.

Note that the name of the two setters is not important, the system looks at the annotation.

    .map(new UserAgentAnalysisMapper<TestRecord>() {
        @Override
        public String getUserAgentString(TestRecord record) {
            return record.useragent;
        }
    
        @SuppressWarnings("unused")
        @YauaaField("DeviceClass")
        public void setDeviceClass(TestRecord record, String value) {
            record.deviceClass = value;
        }
    
        @SuppressWarnings("unused")
        @YauaaField("AgentNameVersion")
        public void setAgentNameVersion(TestRecord record, String value) {
            record.agentNameVersion = value;
        }
    })

## NOTES on defining it as an anonymous class
An anonymous inner class in Java is [by default private](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/319765/accessing-inner-anonymous-class-members).

If you define it as an anonymous inner class as shown above then the system will try to make this class to become public by means of the method .setAccessible(true).
There are situations in which this will fail (amongst others the SecurityManager can block this). If you run into such a scenario then simply 'not' define it inline as an anonymous class and define it as a named (public) class instead.

So the earlier example will look something like this:

    public class MyUserAgentAnalysisMapper extends UserAgentAnalysisMapper<TestRecord> {
        @Override
        public String getUserAgentString(TestRecord record) {
            return record.useragent;
        }
    
        @SuppressWarnings("unused")
        @YauaaField("DeviceClass")
        public void setDeviceClass(TestRecord record, String value) {
            record.deviceClass = value;
        }
    
        @SuppressWarnings("unused")
        @YauaaField("AgentNameVersion")
        public void setAgentNameVersion(TestRecord record, String value) {
            record.agentNameVersion = value;
        }
    }

and then in the topology simply do this

    .map(new MyUserAgentAnalysisMapper())
